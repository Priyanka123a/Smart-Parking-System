This Arduino-based project implements a Smart Parking System with real-time monitoring and feedback using ultrasonic sensors, LEDs, an IR sensor, a servo motor, and an LCD display. Key features of the system include:

Ultrasonic Sensor Distance Measurement:

Three ultrasonic sensors monitor the availability of parking slots.
Distance readings determine if a slot is free or occupied.
IR Sensor for Vehicle Detection:

Detects vehicles at the parking entrance.
Triggers gate operations when a vehicle is detected and slots are available.
Servo Motor for Gate Control:

The servo motor operates the gate by opening and closing it automatically based on vehicle detection and parking availability.
LED Indicators:

Green and red LEDs are used for each parking slot to indicate availability (green) or occupancy (red).
LCD Display for User Feedback:

Displays the real-time status of parking slots (e.g., number of free slots and their respective slot numbers).
Provides feedback such as "Parking Full" when no slots are available.
Serial Monitoring:

Outputs sensor readings and status updates to the Serial Monitor for debugging or data logging.
